## My Contributions  
As a **Full Stack MERN Developer**, I worked on both backend and frontend to ensure **VaultPay** functions efficiently and securely. On the backend, I implemented **RESTful APIs** using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, integrating **MongoDB** for managing user transactions, balances, and linked accounts. I designed a **JWT-based authentication system** with role-based permissions and added **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** to enhance security. I also configured **Stripe payments** to handle secure fund transfers.  

On the frontend, I built **React components** with **Tailwind CSS**, focusing on an intuitive UI for seamless financial management. I optimized state handling with **Redux** to ensure real-time updates on transactions and balances. Additionally, I implemented **QR code-based payments**, expense categorization, and transaction filtering for a better user experience. Collaborating with my team, I worked closely with designers and database engineers to enhance **VaultPayâ€™s** usability, performance, and security.
